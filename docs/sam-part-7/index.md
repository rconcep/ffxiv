# Part 8: encounter-specific tips

[Return home](../)

## Emanation - Lakshmi EX
- Hold your opener until after the thralls are defeated and Lakshmi is targetable.
- Use Hissatsu: Guren on the two thralls if you want to pad.
- Besides the adds phase before her ultimate, the rest of the encounter is basically 100% uptime.
- You can get a full Meditate while waiting for Lakshmi's ultimate.
- Take Arm's Length as a role action to prevent the Divine Denial knockback.
- Take True North as a role action to help keep up your positionals during the cross AoEs.

## The Pool of Tribute - Susano EX
- Hissatsu: Gyoten is amazing here. Use it after the knockbacks if you're targeted and if you're stunned during the Levinbolts.
- Plenty of opportunities here for Third Eye/Hissatsu: Seigan.
- The first phase is a percentage push and at release time lasted anywhere between 75 and 90s. 
- You can get a full Meditate before and after the sword phase.
- Use Hagakure to clear Sen going into the sword phase.
- The remainder of the fight is basically 100% uptime if you're not stunned or gaoled.

## Deltascape V1.0 (Savage) - Alte Roite
- Hissatsu: Gyoten is a godsend. If the main tank uses a gap closer immediately after Downburst and Alte Roite doesn't move, you can use Hissatsu: Gyoten to dodge the outside fireballs and maintain uptime.
    - Similarly useful for Breath Wing, etc.
    - Arm's Length is not effective here IIRC.
- Plenty of opportunities here for Third Eye/Hissatsu: Seigan.
- True North is useful here during sections like Breath Wing when you're hitting it from the front.
- Hissatsu: Yaten's backstep isn't enough to make you jump off the platform so it's useful for when the inner fireballs explode first. Using Hissatu: Yaten gets you the useful Enhanced Enpi when disengaging.
- This fight is basically 100% uptime.

## Deltascape V2.0 (Savage) - Catastrophe
- True North is great for occasions like stacking in the center for Antilight, Gravitational Manipulation+Fourfold Sacrifice (if your main tank stacks with the group), and when stacking on the fleshy members.
- You can adjust your combo order so that you don't need it for all of those situations. For example, Catastrophe shouldn't be facing you for too long during Fourfold Sacrifice stacking so you can move your Yukikaze up and defer your Gekko/Kashsa combo to when you can hit the positional.
- There's a fair amount of momentary forced downtime when placing fleshy members, Unstable Gravity, moving to safe spots, etc. Use Enpi when you can in these situations.
