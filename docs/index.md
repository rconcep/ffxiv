# Samurai by the numbers
## by Tzuyu Chou (Cactuar)
An analytical investigation into playing Samurai in FFXIV optimally in any scenario. This analysis is based on the Python class for Samurai that I've written, located in this repository plus some visualization tools also living in the repository. The format of these pages is of exported Jupyter notebooks that include the code used for analysis. Interested users may clone the code and try out some testing themselves (refer to the [documentation](https://rconcep.github.io/ffxiv-docs/html/).)

The parts are broken up into logical partitions where the gameplay changes significantly. Part 1 covers pre-level 50. Part 2 covers up to the level 50 cap but before Kenki is introduced. Part 3 covers gameplay with Kenki Mastery I. Part 4 covers gameplay with Kenki Mastery II up to the level 70 cap. Part 5 explores advanced, miscellaneous topics for refined optimization points.
